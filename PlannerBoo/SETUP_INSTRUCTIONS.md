# PlannerBoo Setup Instructions

## üö® CRITICAL: Info.plist Configuration Required

**The app will crash when requesting Calendar, Reminders, and Health permissions without proper Info.plist entries.**

### Step-by-Step Setup:

#### 1. Open Xcode Project Settings
1. Open your project in Xcode
2. Select the **PlannerBoo** target (not the project)
3. Go to the **"Info"** tab
4. Look for the "Custom iOS Target Properties" section

#### 2. Add Required Permission Descriptions

Click the **"+"** button next to any existing entry and add these **exact** keys:

| Key | Type | Value |
|-----|------|-------|
| `NSHealthShareUsageDescription` | String | `PlannerBoo would like to access your health data to display step counts and workout information in your daily planner.` |
| `NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription` | String | `PlannerBoo would like to update your health data to log activities from your planner.` |
| `NSCalendarsUsageDescription` | String | `PlannerBoo needs access to your calendar to create and sync events with your planner.` |
| `NSRemindersUsageDescription` | String | `PlannerBoo needs access to your reminders to create and manage tasks from your planner.` |
| `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` | String | `PlannerBoo needs access to your photo library to add images to your planner pages.` |
| `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription` | String | `PlannerBoo needs permission to save images to your photo library from your planner.` |

#### 3. Enable Permissions in Code

After adding Info.plist entries, uncomment the permission code in `PermissionsManager.swift`:

1. Find the `checkCalendarAccess()`, `checkRemindersAccess()`, and `checkHealthAccess()` methods
2. Uncomment the code inside each method
3. Find the `requestCalendarAccess()`, `requestRemindersAccess()`, and `requestHealthAccess()` methods  
4. Uncomment the code inside each method
5. Update the onboarding view to re-enable the permission rows

#### 4. Add HealthKit Entitlement (Optional)

For HealthKit to work, you also need to add the capability:

1. **Select PlannerBoo target** ‚Üí **"Signing & Capabilities" tab**
2. **Click "+ Capability"**
3. **Search for "HealthKit"** and double-click to add
4. **Verify** it shows as "HealthKit ‚úì"

#### 5. Enable HealthKit in Code (After Adding Entitlement)

After adding the HealthKit entitlement, uncomment the HealthKit code in `PermissionsManager.swift`.
